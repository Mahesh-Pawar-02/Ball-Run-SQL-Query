You are working with a MySQL database that tracks cricket match scores. You have a table named cricket_scores with the following structure:

Each row in this table represents the runs scored on a particular ball. The ball column indicates the ball number in the match (e.g., ball 1, ball 2, etc.), and the run column indicates the runs scored on that ball.
1.	Create a database named Mahesh if it does not already exist.
2.	Create the cricket_scores table in the Mahesh database with the columns ball and run.
3.	Insert the following data into the cricket_scores table:

4.	Write a query to display all records from the cricket_scores table.
5.	Write a query to calculate the total runs scored per over. An over consists of 6 balls, so group the runs by over, where the first 6 balls are in over 1, the next 6 balls are in over 2, and so on. Your query should show the over number and the total runs scored in that over.
